               of Arizona and New Mexico were first synthesized and compared by
               ethnologist Elsie Clews Parsons. Prodigious research and a
               quarter-century of fieldwork went into her 1939 encyclopedic
               two-volume work, Pueblo Indian Religion. The author gives an
               integrated picture of the complex religious and social life in
               the pueblos, including Zuni, Acoma, Laguna, Taos, Isleta,
               Sandia, Jemez, Cochiti, Santa Clara, San Felipe, Santa Domingo,
               San Juan, and the Hopi villages. In volume I she discusses
               shelter, social structure, land tenure, customs, and popular
               beliefs. Parsons also describes spirits, cosmic notions, and a
               wide range of rituals.The cohesion of spiritual and material
               aspects of Pueblo culture is also apparent in volume II, which
               presents an extensive body of solstice, installation,
               initiation, war, weather, curing, kachina, and planting and
               harvesting ceremonies, as well as games, animal dances, and
               offerings to the dead. A review of Pueblo ceremonies from town
               to town considers variations and borrowings. Today, a half
               century after its original publication, Pueblo Indian Religion
               remains central to studies of Pueblo religious life.",

              represented by point types documented in western North America
              through comparison with ethnohistorically documented Native
              American interactive networks at different levels of inclusion.
              The ethnohistorical data come from Joseph Jorgensen's (1980)
              Western Indians, which maps tribal boundaries at European contact
              and the associated language lineage for each tribe. We assume
              that frequency of interaction follows language relationships.
              Proximity aside, people will share ideas more often if they
              possess a language, or part of a language, in common. We use
              tribal regions and different levels of language affiliation
              (families, large language groupings, and phyla) that represent
              increasingly broad spatial scales of social interaction. We
              compare these measures with the areas calculated for point types
              in the same general region to determine which level of social
              interaction recorded ethnohistorically best fits with the point
              type data. Our analyses show that point type areas most closely
              resemble the spatial extents of large language groupings and
              language phyla. The areas of point types are greater than
              individual tribal regions recorded in western North America at
              the time of European contact and language families. Based on
              these results, we suggest that the conflation of point types with
              prehistoric cultures commonly implied in archeology is not
              justified. Building on the fundamental ideas of the culture
              historians, we suggest that point type distributions are a
              consequence of extensive social interaction networks where
              combinations of functional and neutral point traits are shared
              and inherited over a large area.",

               which flaked-stone points that varied in impact strength by a
               factor of almost three were shot at media that were increasingly
               inelastic and therefore likely to break the points. Broken tips
               were reworked if possible, and used again under the same
               conditions. Our results show that all damage to low
               impact-strength materials, especially obsidian, was generally
               catastrophic, and, consequently, these points could only rarely
               be reworked. The fact that low-strength stones were commonly
               used to make small arrowpoints suggests that reworking was not a
               primary concern for their designers. Furthermore, in those
               instances when broken tips could be reworked, their performance
               declined. In addition, reworking broken points also resulted in
               shapes that are uncommon in many arrowpoint assemblages. Our
               results suggest that the original design attributes of
               arrowpoints may have been less affected by reworking, and,
               consequently, may more accurately suggest temporal and

              used to compare the shapes of the blades of Clovis, Folsom and
              Plainview points from the Southern Plains of North America. In

              Plainview points, but does not distinguish Folsom points from
              Plainview points. The analyses also show that the similarities

              allometry, raw material quality, and resharpening. These findings

  abstract = "In this article, data from the ethnographic and archaeological
              records are correlated to examine the proposal that some
              projectile points had social and symbolic functions. Although
              archaeologists have long recognized that projectile points could
              have multiple functions, few have examined the social and
              symbolic functions these objects had. This article discusses the
              thorough examination of ethnographic documents primarily from the
              US Southwest written during the nineteenth and twentieth
              centuries, which reveal that stone projectile points had multiple
              social and symbolic functions. After a discussion of the compiled
              ethnographic data, data from the analysis of over 600 stone
              points from the northern U.S. Southwest dating to AD 900--1300 is
              presented. The stone projectile point data reveals that while the
              majority of projectile points were used as tips to arrows, some
              did serve social and symbolic functions similar to those observed
              in the ethnographic record. With this data in hand, I argue that
              archaeologists must approach projectile points as more than just

              etnografica para examinar la noci{\'o}n de que las puntas de
              proyectiles ten{\'\i}an usos sociales y simb{\'o}licos. Por mucho
              tiempo arque{\'o}logos han reconocido que las puntas de
              proyectiles pudieron haber tenido m{\'u}ltiples usos, sin embargo
              muy pocos han examinado los usos sociales y simb{\'o}licos que
              estos objetos tuvieron. Este articulo incluye una examinaci{\'o}n
              de documentos etnogr{\'a}ficos principalmente del Suroeste
              Americano y escritos durante los siglos 19 y 20 que revelan que
              las puntas de proyectiles ten{\'\i}an una variedad de usos
              simb{\'o}licos y sociales. Despu{\'e}s de una discusi{\'o}n de
              estos documentos etnogr{\'a}ficos, presentar{\'e} datos de un
              an{\'a}lisis de m{\'a}s de 600 puntas de proyectiles de la
              regi{\'o}n norte del suroeste Americano. Estas puntas fechan
              entre los a{\~n}os AD 900--1300. Estos datos revelan que mientras
              que la mayor{\'\i}a de puntas de proyectil fueron usadas como
              flechas, otras ten{\'\i}an usos sociales y simb{\'o}licos
              similares a los que se pueden ver en los documentos
              etnogr{\'a}ficos. Con estos datos, deseo sostener que
              arque{\'o}logos deben de percibir a las puntas de proyectil como
              algo m{\'a}s que una arma, y que un an{\'a}lisis de estos objetos
              puede revelar mas que simple cronolog{\'\i}a y fronteras

               obsidian projectile points were manufactured to specific
               lengths, widths, and thicknesses. These were then fired into a
               deer carcass with a bow repeatedly until each point broke. None
               of the points were resharpened. The hardness of the material
               struck was a significant predictor of a point's durability.
               Controlling for this variable, however, we found that points
               with a high thickness: length ratio (>.121) were slightly albeit
               significantly more durable than those with a low ratio. No other

              A Comparison Between Ethnographic Arrows and Archaeological
              Projectile Points from Late Holocene {Fuego-Patagonia}",

  abstract = "Under certain conditions, ethnographic analogies can help to shed
              light on past behaviors registered in the archaeological record
              via observation and model-building from modern societies. In this
              context, ethnographic weapons are often used as morphometric
              models to assign a given function to archaeological projectile
              points. For southern Patagonia, J. Bird proposed a functional
              analogy between arrows used by the Ona (also known as Selk'nam),
              a hunter-gatherer group that inhabited northern Tierra del Fuego
              during historical epochs, and the type V Late Holocene projectile
              points from southern continental Patagonia. Based on the
              similarity in terms of small size and shape attributes between
              the type V archaeological points and Ona (Selk'nam) ethnographic
              arrows, Bird proposed that the former were arrow points. Here we
              test the morphometric analogy based on comparisons of size and
              shape variables defining Ona (Selk'nam) arrows from museum
              ethnographic collections, and type V projectile points from
              southern Patagonia archaeological sites. Then, we assess the
              relative importance of projectile point reduction as a source of
              morphometric variation. We compared both, archaeological and
              ethnographic points using geometric morphometrics and
              multivariate statistical analyses. Results showed significant
              shape differences between ethnographic and archaeological samples
              before and after controlling for size and reduction parameters,
              suggesting that both kinds of points had different designs and
              life histories. However, when spear-like points are included in
              the comparison, Ona (Selk'nam) and type V points tend to cluster
              together. The results obtained from this broader comparison
              framework suggest that, when functional diversity and reduction
              effects are taken into account, ethnographic weapons can be
              considered as useful morphometric models to infer the function of
              archaeological points. Our results highlight the importance of
              considering similarities in environment, subsistence, mobility,
              tool design constraints, and lithic characteristics prior any
              extrapolation based on ethnographic analogies.",

               prehistory by Native American peoples. Written for

               over 50 types of stone arrowhead and spear points according to

               trained to fashion projectile points with techniques used by the

               re-sharpened. His detailed drawings illustrate the way the
               Indians shaped their tools, what styles were peculiar to which
               regions, and how the various types can best be identified. There
               are hundreds of drawings, organized by type cluster and other
               identifying characteristics. The book also includes distribution

               messages. A detailed analysis of projectile points, arrow

               so-called ?Magician? of Ridge Ruin demonstrates the power of
               specific burial analyses to reconstruct the ritual and social
               context of a funeral ceremony. The Magician, an adult Sinagua

               Southwest, has been central to social interpretations of the

               painted miniature bows and an assemblage of 434 projectile
               points, which have not been fully described before. These

               members of a warrior sodality. In the broader context of the
               entire burial, the analysis reinforces a model of social
               heterarchy in which the Magician was especially important

              archaeological sites are placed into chronological frameworks.
              This approach relies on the assumption that artifacts at undated
              sites---usually projectile points---are coeval with similar
              artifacts found at other, dated sites. While typological
              cross-dating is necessary in regions dominated by open-air lithic
              scatters, the approach can be problematic when undated and dated
              sites are separated by significant distances. Here, we present
              radiocarbon dates on projectile points with organic hafting
              material still attached or found within organic storage bags. Our
              results provide unequivocal ages for various morphological
              projectile point types at several Great Basin locales and should
              be useful to researchers seeking local age estimates for those
              point types, which often involves relying on chronological data
              from more distant sites. The results also highlight potential
              issues with uncritically applying typological crossdating using
              typologies based on metric attributes, and in two cases, suggest
              the need to revise the age ranges for certain point styles in the
              western Great Basin. Fechado por comparaci{\'o}n tipol{\'o}gica

               represents and adapts to these individualities, bringing the
               data together into a single curve. For IntCal20, the statistical
               methodology has undergone a complete redesign, from the random
               walk used in IntCal04, IntCal09 and IntCal13, to an approach
               based upon Bayesian splines with errors-in-variables. The new
               spline approach is still fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
               (MCMC) but offers considerable advantages over the previous

               regression surface through a multivariate smoothing procedure,
               fitting a function of the independent variables locally and in a
               moving fashion analogous to how a moving average is computed for
               a time series. With local fitting we can estimate a much wider
               class of regression surfaces than with the usual classes of
               parametric functions, such as polynomials. The goal of this
               article is to show, through applications, how loess can be used
               for three purposes: data exploration, diagnostic checking of
               parametric models, and providing a nonparametric regression
               surface. Along the way, the following methodology is introduced:
               (a) a multivariate smoothing procedure that is an extension of
               univariate locally weighted regression; (b) statistical
               procedures that are analogous to those used in the least-squares
               fitting of parametric functions; (c) several graphical methods

               checking the assumptions on which the estimation procedure is

  abstract = "The `Victoria West' is a Lower Paleolithic industry from South
              Africa, which includes prepared cores and has previously been
              noted to bear strong morphological resemblances with later Middle
              Paleolithic prepared core technologies (i.e. Levallois cores).
              Indeed, from the earliest commentaries on the Victoria West, it
              has frequently been thought of as a `large Levallois' variant.
              The hypothesis that VW cores are accurately characterised as
              `large Levallois' is tested here using a comparative 3D geometric
              morphometric (GM) methodology. GM methods are powerful
              statistical tools for shape analysis that offer many advantages
              over traditional means of shape quantification and comparison.
              The use of landmarks to capture shape variation allows for the
              preservation of the full geometry, as well as enabling the more
              precise description of shape versus size. Moreover, biological
              studies have shown that the use of landmarks allows for a
              flexible approach to comparing specific aspects of overall
              morphology. Here, we employ GM to analyse differences in core
              surface morphology in a range of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic
              artefacts, including Victoria West examples (total n=639
              artefacts). In comparison with cores from non-handaxe Mode 1,
              Acheulean handaxes, and Levallois cores, the Victoria West share
              shape affinities with both Acheulean handaxes and Levallois
              cores. However, when compared directly with a group of large
              Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores from Baker's Hole (UK), the
              Victoria West were found to more closely resemble handaxes, while
              the Baker's Hole set are simply isometrically-scaled Levallois
              cores. These analyses show that, despite broad technological and
              qualitative morphological similarities with Levallois cores,
              Victoria West cores are morphologically more similar to Lower
              Palaeolithic artefact forms, such as handaxes, and are in some
              respects distinct from Middle Palaeolithic Levallois cores. In
              line with other recent analyses, our results support suggestions
              that the Victoria West technique is an extension of longstanding
              Acheulean traditions for the preparation of biface blanks, but
              with its own distinct characteristics.",

  abstract = "Archaeologists often wish to distinguish between groups of
              cultural artifacts using information collected from descriptions
              or measurements of their morphological forms. Morphometric
              methods have played an increasingly large role in such
              quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to
              morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact
              types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be
              quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or
              semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that
              investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under
              consideration are important to include at the outset of an
              investigation. In this review results obtained from
              landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of
              a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are
              compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for
              the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data
              type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the
              dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its
              effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data
              analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the
              lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the
              Na{\"\i}ve Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the
              highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric
              morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings
              suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans,
              using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or
              machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with
              tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a
              wide range of artifact types.",

  abstract = "This study seeks to study the social processes of community
              reorganization through the changing technological organization of
              flaked stone tools. The Mogollon Rim region of east-central
              Arizona, between AD 1000 and AD 1400, was the scene of remarkable
              social changes. In this period, migrants were attracted into the
              region and new small communities were created. After a period of
              dispersed settlement pattern communities, some of the communities
              developed large, aggregated settlements. In this process of
              aggregation, community growth was facilitated by the
              incorporation of migrants. Social integrative forces at work
              included the development of interhousehold exchanges, as well as
              informal and formal suprahousehold organi2^tions. In spite of
              these social integrative forces. communit>' dissolution and
              abandonment sooner or later came to all of these settlements. The
              technology of daily life is one means of exploring these social
              organizational forces. Chipped stone studies have been behind the
              times in the American Southwest when addressing social
              organization research through the examination of Pueblo chipped
              stone assemblages. Technological organization is a creation of
              households and suprahousehold groups. Technological organization
              changes as community organization changes. This study examines
              the chipped stone tools and debitage from ten east-central
              Arizona pueblos, forming inferences about how the organization of
              chipped stone tool production, distribution, consumption, and
              discard was arranged in each community. Each community studied
              was a product of migrants and resident families, social
              exchanges, social integration, and social dissolution. This study
              demonstrates the utility of chipped stone analysis for studying
              the social processes at work in communities.",

              sequences, phylogenetic relations, among other issues. The
              application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp
              increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical
              approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated

              the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its
              methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some

              GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much

              from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above

              discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in

               those of their fluted and unfluted Paleoindian Tradition
               technological counterparts, largely due to the paucity of
               extensive WST lithic assemblages recovered from intact buried

  abstract  = "This monograph takes a fresh look at migration in light of the
               recent resurgence of interest in this topic within archaeology.
               The author develops a reliable approach for detecting and
               assessing the impact of migration based on conceptions of style
               in anthropology. From numerous ethnoarchaeological and
               ethnohistoric case studies, material culture attributes are
               isolated that tend to be associated only with the groups that
               produce them. Clark uses this approach to evaluate Puebloan
               migration into the Tonto Basin of east-central Arizona during
               the early Classic period (A.D. 1200-1325), focusing on a
               community that had been developing with substantial Hohokam
               influence prior to this interval. He identifies Puebloan
               enclaves in the indigenous settlements based on culturally
               specific differences in the organization of domestic space and
               in technological styles reflected in wall construction and
               utilitarian ceramic manufacture. Puebloan migration was
               initially limited in scale, resulting in the co-residence of
               migrants and local groups within a single community. Once this
               co-residence settlement pattern is reconstructed, relations
               between the two groups are examined and the short-term and
               long-term impacts of migration are assessed. The early Classic
               period is associated with the appearance of the Salado horizon
               in the Tonto Basin. The results of this research suggest that
               migration and co-residence was common throughout the basins and
               valleys in the region defined by the Salado horizon, although
               each local sequence relates a unique story. The methodological
               and theoretical implications of Clark's work extend well beyond
               the Salado and the Southwest and apply to any situation in which
               the scale and impact of prehistoric migration are contested.",

               Breakage patterns and morphological change of points resulting

               visibility. The assemblages resulting from point production and
               rejuvenation are quite different from one another and each can
               be identified through a technological analysis. The study
               indicates that a curational behavior such as rejuvenation can be
               identified in the archaeological record if the proper sampling,

              New York, is studied using 2D elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA)
              in order to assess the applicability of formal tool typologies
              for the region. Lithic analysts have questioned two types of
              triangle, Levanna and Madison, as valid analytic units as they
              are quantifiably indeterminate when measured using caliper
              methods such as length and width. The geometric morphometric
              analysis here takes outline data from a previously studied

              recent scholarship that conflates the two types into one. This

              geometry, computer graphics and biometrics in techniques for the
              multivariate analysis of biological shape variation. Although
              medical image analysts typically prefer to represent scenes by
              way of curving outlines or surfaces, the most recent developments
              in this associated statistical methodology have emphasized the
              domain of landmark data: size and shape of configurations of
              discrete, named points in two or three dimensions. This paper
              introduces a combination of Procrustes analysis and thin-plate
              splines, the two most powerful tools of landmark-based
              morphometrics, for multivariate analysis of curving outlines in
              samples of biomedical images. The thin-plate spline is used to
              assign point-to-point correspondences, called semi-landmarks,
              between curves of similar but variable shape, while the standard
              algorithm for Procrustes shape averages and shape coordinates is
              altered to accord with the ways in which semi-landmarks formally
              differ from more traditional landmark loci. Subsequent
              multivariate statistics and visualization proceed mainly as in
              the landmark-based methods. The combination provides a range of
              complementary filters, from high pass to low pass, for effects on
              outline shape in grouped studies. The low-pass version is based
              on the spectrum of the spline, the high pass, on a familiar
              special case of Procrustes analysis. This hybrid method is
              demonstrated in a comparison of the shape of the corpus callosum
              from mid-sagittal sections of MRI of 25 human brains, 12 normal
              and 13 with schizophrenia.",

               participate in communities of practitioners, moving toward full
               participation in the sociocultural practices of a community.

  abstract = "Recent critiques of the culture-historical approach to ethnicity
              have denounced the idea that archaeological cultures are ?actors?
              on the historical stage, playing the role that known individuals
              or groups have in documentary history. But the critique has gone
              as far as to claim that, because archaeologists supposedly have
              no access to the meaning of cultural traditions, medieval
              ethnicity cannot be studied by archeological means. Ethnicity
              should be banned from all discussions, if medieval archaeology is
              to make any progress in the future. The paper examines the
              theoretical malaise at the root of this scepticism verging on
              nihilism. The understanding of the archaeological record not as
              an imprint, but as a text allows for much learning about meaning
              in the past. Symbols, style and power are the key concepts that
              currently guide anthropological research on ethnicity as a
              ?social construction of primordiality?. As several archaeological
              examples show, medieval ethnicity was a form of social
              mobilization used in order to reach certain political goals.
              Ethnic identity was built upon some pre-existing cultural
              identity, in a prototypic manner.",

  abstract = "Traditional artifact typologies are typically poorly defined.
              While several attributes usually help define a ``type,'' shape is
              invariably the most important. Here I report on a study that uses
              landmark-based geometric morphometrics to better define three
              Paleoindian point types from Florida: Suwannees, Simpsons, and
              Transitional Side Notched. Bilaterally symmetric specimens were
              created from the original artifacts to capture the presumed
              ideational forms of the points. The shapes of the bases and the
              entire points were tested to determine whether the types could be
              discriminated, and if so which shape was best at discriminating
              the types. The results show that the base configurations were
              best at discriminating the groups in two different jackknife
              allocation tests. The entire point shape was less robust due to
              the variability in blade shape. The study demonstrates that the
              three point types can be rigorously defined in ways that are
              usable in daily archaeological practice, and that base shape,
              rather than the entire shape, is a better discriminator. Further,
              the study demonstrates the utility of using several freeware
              programs for processing and analyzing shape data.",
