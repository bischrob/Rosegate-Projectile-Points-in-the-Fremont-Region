abstract: 'The Fremont projectile point typology was developed in the 1980s.

Some archaeologists recognize that these projectile points persist to approximately AD 1300 but others use the earlier date range, and much of the relevant information is confined to gray literature. Furthermore, there is a varied approach to these types. Some use the original two types, while others use Rosegate or a combination of Rosegate, Rose Spring, and Eastgate. We used projectile point typology data, illustrations, and photographs to study the temporal range and morphological variation of Rosegate points. We find that Rosegate points were in common use for the duration of the Fremont period (ca. AD 1300), with some decline over time. A spatial analysis demonstrates that the points are widespread in the Fremont region but are not evenly distributed.

# Introduction

Archaeologists working in the Fremont region have benefited for decades
from a standard projectile point typology established in the 1980s
(Holmer 1986; Holmer and Weder 1980). Numerous excavations have since
occurred, and a wealth of new projectile point data and absolute dates
are now available. Given this new data, we believe it is time for a
general review of Fremont projectile point types; however, this study is
limited to two questions we argue are in particular need of addressing:
(1) how long do Rosegate points persist in the Fremont region, and (2)
should Rosegate points be considered separately as Rose Spring
Corner-notched and Eastgate Expanding-stem (hereafter Rose Spring and
Eastgate)?

Definitions of Fremont diverge, but, by any definition, most Fremont
people were small-scale horticulturalists relying on a mixture of maize
and other cultigens, as well as wild resources (for recent summaries see
Allison 2015; see also Madsen and Simms 1998; Simms 2008). The Fremont
can be considered an archaeological culture region and a period, dating
primarily from AD 700-1300. The Fremont region comprises much of what is
now the state of Utah, north of the Virgin and Colorado rivers, as well
as bordering states. Fremont populations reached their peak and greatest
spatial extent between AD 1000-1300 (Talbot 2000:278). The end of
horticulture in the region, and thus the end of the Fremont period, was
approximately AD 1300 in most areas (Allison 2010). Many characteristics
are reminiscent of neighboring cultures in the Southwest, but
distinctive rock art, moccasins, basketry, figurines, and a handful of
other traits distinguish the Fremont from their neighbors to the south
(Talbot 2000).

The chronology of Rosegate point types is of particular importance, as
Fremont dating is poorly developed, especially when compared to the
high-resolution tree-ring and ceramic chronologies used in adjacent
areas of the Southwest. Many Fremont ceramic types are sufficient only
to identify a site to the Fremont period (see Madsen 1977), which places
additional importance on the use of projectile points as chronological
markers. Rosegate projectile points (Figure 1) are commonly found at
Fremont sites in the eastern Great Basin and Colorado Plateau. They
appear to be the earliest projectile points associated with the bow and
arrow, which was introduced to the area sometime between AD 1 and 600
(Heizer and Baumhoff 1961:128; Hester 1973:126; Holmer 1986:107; Lanning
1963:249,252). Holmer and Weder (also Holmer 1986:107; 1980:60) state
that Rosegate points persist until AD 900-1000. This contrasts with the
central and western Great Basin where these points are known to date up
to AD 1300 (Smith et al. 2013; Thomas 1981:19). Several archaeologists
have commented on the late persistence of Rosegate points in Fremont
sites (e.g., Aikens 1970:56; Baadsgaard and Janetski 2005:135; Berry
2005:749; Talbot et al. 1999:109; Wilde and Soper 1999:102); however,
these discussions are in the context of individual sites or projects and
much of it exists in gray literature that is difficult to access.
Furthermore, Holmer and Weder's dates are still commonly cited in
Fremont literature and may cause inaccurate interpretations. Various
other point styles, most commonly small side-notched points, appear
between AD 900-1000 throughout the Fremont region and are argued to have
replaced Rosegate points (Holmer 1986; Holmer and Weder 1980). This
coincides with the corner-notched to side-notched transition in the rest
of the Southwest (Whittaker and Bryce 2017:635), and in the Central
Plains (e.g., Hughes 2017), which makes this a relevant topic beyond the
Fremont region. While Rosegate points clearly declined in relative
abundance through time, our investigation using projectile point data
from 22 sites indicates that they were relatively common until the end
of the Fremont period. We argue these points should be used as
indicators of a pre-AD 1000 date only in large assemblages that contain
no other arrowpoint styles. A spatial analysis of the data indicates
Rosegate points are also widespread in the Fremont region after AD 1000,
but these points are more concentrated in some areas.

```

Whether Rosegate points should be discussed as two separate types is
less critical than their age, but several approaches are in common use
and a clearer understanding of how the two types are related may
generate greater uniformity in intersite syntheses. The relatively
recent adoption of geometric morphometrics in archaeology provides an
opportune method for investigating this question (see Cardillo 2010;
MacLeod 2017; Mitteroecker and Gunz 2009; Okumura and Araujo 2019; Shott
and Trail 2010). The field of geometric morphometrics has grown rapidly
since its primary origin in the early 1990s in biology and is now a
mature field (Adams et al. 2013; Bookstein 1991; Corti 1993;
Mitteroecker and Gunz 2009; Rohlf and Marcus 1993). Geometric
morphometrics can be used to analyze shape data using coordinates or
outlines on 2D or 3D data (Rohlf and Marcus 1993), and a growing number
of studies use these methods to analyze projectile points in (e.g.,
Buchanan and Collard 2010; Charlin and González-José 2018; Davis et al.
2017; Fisher 2018; Fox 2015; Okumura and Araujo 2015, 2016; Selden et
al. 2020; Shott and Trail 2010; Smith et al. 2015; Thulman 2012). We
found this approach useful for distinguishing types of points, although
projectile points currently defined as Eastgate and Rose Spring could
not be easily separated.

In this paper, we briefly review the Fremont and Rosegate projectile
points before using the accumulated projectile point dataset in
combination with a radiocarbon database compiled for this study to
address the persistence of Rosegate points. We examine the spatial
distribution of Rosegate points in this study and Rose Spring data
collected by Holmer and Weder (1980) to examine whether Rosegate points
are spatially clustered. We use Rosegate illustrations and photographs
from eight Fremont sites to examine Rosegate morphology using methods
from geometric morphometrics. We also discuss future directions for
projectile point research in the Fremont region.

# Rosegate Projectile Points

The standard projectile point typology for the Fremont region was
developed by Holmer and Weder in 1980. Some of the dates were slightly
modified by Holmer (1986)--- Rosegate points are extended to AD 1000
from the AD 900 date given in the original Holmer and Weder publication.
One argument for differentiating the types is that, according to Holmer
and Weder (1980:60), Eastgate points are only found in the Great Basin,
while the distribution of Rose Spring points is more widespread, but
they had few examples of Eastgate points to work with. Justice
(2002a:333--336) notes a wider distribution of Eastgate points than
Holmer and Weder do, but much of the Fremont region is still not
included (Figure 2). Some archaeologists use Rose Spring and Eastgate as
initially defined by Holmer and Weder, while others use a hybrid
approach with three categories: Rose Spring, Eastgate, and Rosegate. The
latter term is reserved for ambiguous points that clearly belong to the
Eastgate/Rose Spring morphological continuum but are difficult to
classify definitively as one or the other.

```{r figure 2, fig.cap=captions[8]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 2.jpg')
```

Rose Spring points were initially defined at the Rose Spring site in
California by Lanning (1963) and are distributed throughout the Great
Basin, Colorado Plateau, and surrounding areas (see Justice
2002a:320--330). They are corner-notched and are typically long and
slender. Eastgate points were defined from excavations at Wagon Jack
Shelter in Nevada by Heizer and Baumhoff (1961) and are generally
restricted to the Great Basin. They have deep parallel notches in the
base that create barbs extending from the blade. Holmer (1986:107,
Figure 16) assigns Rosegate points to the period between AD 300 and
900-1000. This contrasts with the central and western Great Basin where
these points are known to date up to AD 1300 or later (Garfinkel 2007;
Smith et al. 2013; Thomas 1981:19). Hildebrandt and colleagues (2016:88)
add that Rosegate temporal spans vary regionally, which suggests the
results of this analysis focused on the Fremont region should not be
used elsewhere. Recognizing the proposed temporal differences for
Rosegate points in the eastern Great Basin, Holmer (1986:107) cites the
western edge of the Fremont as a boundary for Rosegate points after AD
900-1000. He does note that this is not an absolute chronological
boundary, as some Rosegate points were found in Evans Mound, which dates
after AD 1000. Holmer (1986:107) and Holmer and Weder (1980:60) state
that Rosegate points were replaced by a variety of later Fremont point
types including side-notched, basal-notched, and concave-based points.
These later points are commonly found until the end of the Fremont, ca.
AD 1300, when they were replaced by Desert series points.

# Temporal Range

Our interest in the Rosegate chronology was sparked by excavations at
Wolf Village, located at the south end of Utah Valley. This site has
nine excavated structures and an unusually large assemblage of artifacts
for the Fremont region (Johansson et al. 2014; Lambert et al. 2016). An
early occupation (Wolf Village 1) most likely dates to the late AD 600s.
A total of 61 projectile points were found associated with two activity
areas dating to the early occupation (Lambert et al. 2016). Of the 61
projectile points found in these areas, 87% (n = 53) are Rosegate
points; almost all the other points are either dart points or
indeterminate points. The one exception is a Nawthis side-notched point
that was found immediately below the modern surface, and probably dates
to the later occupation of the site (Wolf Village 2). The lack of other
Fremont projectile point types fits the expected chronology and matches
the radiocarbon dates; however, 137 Rosegate projectile points were
found in later contexts, comprising 19% of all projectile points from
the later occupation. Radiocarbon and tree-ring dates place this
occupation between the mid AD 1000s and early 1100s (Johansson et al.
2014:35; Lambert 2018:41). No early dates were obtained from these
areas, and none of the structures were superimposed over substantially
earlier occupations. The Rosegate points were mostly found associated
with floors or the fill of the structures and were found in association
with other point types. These Rosegate points were not associated with
any evidence for an earlier occupation, and the associated assemblages
all appear to date at least several decades, and possibly more than a
century, after AD 1000. The initial analysis of projectile points was
based on Holmer and Weder's chronology, which suggested the presence of
Rosegate points in the later assemblages was anomalous and led to the
questions we address in this study.

In order to determine whether Rosegate points are commonly found after
AD 1000 in other Fremont sites, we assembled a database of 21 sites
containing 5,744 projectile points and 1,707 Rosegate points (Table 1;
Figure 3 displays site locations). The sites included are a subset of
excavated Fremont sites. We first looked for sites in Utah Valley, close
to Wolf Village, and then expanded our search to other Fremont sites
creating an opportunistic sample. We concentrated on sites with a large
number of analyzed projectile points. We also primarily looked for
reports that used Holmer and Weder's typology, to better maintain
consistency in the data. Because we are primarily interested in the
relationship of Rosegate points to other points associated with the bow
and arrow, we calculated percentages of Rosegate points to the total
number of arrow points. We removed all point types usually associated
with the Archaic period, or more accurately with the atlatl. Small
numbers of these points were found at nearly every site and may have
been used as knives (Weder 1980:44). Hildebrandt and King (2012; see
also Weder 1980) outline a convenient method of discriminating between
dart and arrow points by adding the neck width and maximum thickness.
This method was used as a general, but not absolute, guideline for the
Wolf Village points, as well as for points from recent excavations at
the Hinckley Mounds site in Provo. When working with published data from
other sites, we assigned points as dart points based on the reported
type. There are likely a few errors in assigning points to arrows or
atlatl darts, but this distinction is important in this study as some
sites---particularly caves---had long occupations that often predate the
arrival of the bow and arrow; thus, removing dart points provides a more
accurate picture of how common Rosegate points are versus other arrow
points in the assemblages. Percentages stated below are based on the
number of Rosegate relative to the total number of arrow points.

```

To evaluate the chronology, we compiled a database of 218 radiocarbon
dates from published sources and new dates (see supplemental table). We
also compared the dates with the chronological estimates given by the
authors of each report to ensure contextual information and other dating
methods did not affect the analysis. Dates were calibrated using the
intcal20 standard (Heaton et al. 2020) and converted to calendar years
using the Bchron package (Haslett and Parnell 2008) in R (R Core Team
2020). Many older radiocarbon dates suffer from the well-known old-wood
problem common in Fremont archaeology (Allison 2016); thus, where
possible, we focused on more recently taken dates from annual plants
(mostly maize), including a number of previously unpublished dates.

```{r figure 4, fig.cap=captions[10]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 4.jpg')
```

```{r figure 5, fig.cap=captions[11]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 5.jpg')
```

Figure 4 shows the distribution of dates, which peaks at around AD 1100.
Figure 5 shows the sites in this study arranged chronologically
according to median radiocarbon date. Medians of the dates on annual
plants are depicted separately from the median of all dates, although
for most sites the annual plant dates are not significantly
different---Backhoe Village being the primary exception. Most sites have
median dates after AD 1000, but each site contains Rosegate projectile
points. Figure 6 shows the median dates compared to the Rosegate
percentage at each site. There is a clear decline over time, but the
decline slows at around AD 1000, and the loess smoothing line (see
Cleveland and Devlin 1988) never dips below 25%. There is also much
greater variation after AD 1000. A linear regression of these data
returns an adjusted *r^2^* of 0.31 (*F* = 9.7*, df* = 22*, p =* 0.01).
Rosegate points do decline over time, but they cannot account for most
of the variation in dating for these sites.

```{r figure 6, fig.cap=captions[12]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 6.jpg')
```

To simplify the chronology, we have divided the sites into early and
late periods for some analyses. Sites dating before approximately AD
1000 are defined as early, and sites dating after this period are
defined as late. Several sites did not have accurate enough data to
easily separate the assemblages, or the date ranges significantly
overlap the early and late periods and cannot be confidently assigned to
one or the other. A conservative approach was taken when assigning sites
to periods and most sites were placed in the mixed category. Even in
sites confidently assigned to the late period, Rosegate percentages
ranged as high as 46% and were never lower than 9% (see Table 2 for
percentages by period and Figure 7 for all site percentages).

```{r figure 7, fig.cap=captions[13]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 7.jpg')
```

```{r table 2}
t2 <- import('Rosegate Table 2.xlsx')
names(t2)[1] <- ' '
t2 %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T, caption = captions[3]) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10,full_width = F, position = "center")
```

Only three sites in the dataset are assigned to the early period:
Mosquito Willies, Lost Ridge, and the early component at Wolf Village.
Rosegate points make up 94% of the combined projectile point assemblages
from these sites. Most of the other points are undetermined points that
are either too fragmented to classify, or else represent uncommon or
untyped variants. The high percentage of Rosegate points for these sites
substantiates the current view that Rosegate points are the earliest
arrow points in the Fremont region. The sample size in this dataset is
small, but no other arrow points are known to be produced in this
period.

# Spatial Distribution

Nine sites clearly date primarily to the late period. The percentage of
Rosegate points drops to 23% in the combined late assemblages, but with
considerable variation between sites. The South Temple site has the
highest percentage of Rosegate points in this period at 46%, but the
Kay's Cabin site only has 9%. Notably, several late sites have large
numbers of Rosegate points; Baker Village has the most with 142 out of
539 points (26%).

Most of the sites could not clearly be dated entirely after or before AD
1000. Rosegate points comprise 34% of points from the sites assigned to
the mixed category. Long or multiple occupations, such as American Fork
Cave, are one cause of dating problems, but in many cases, the
radiocarbon error range is too large to rule out earlier dates.
Allison's (2016, 2019) analysis of radiocarbon dates indicates that
Fremont populations rapidly increased starting at about AD 1000 and it
is probable that most of the points in these sites date after the
presumed end of Rosegate points. Regardless, the sites that clearly date
after AD 1000 have too many Rosegate points to be attributed to the
curation of old points.

Some sites have widely differing radiocarbon dates and one possible
explanation for the occurrence of Rosegate points in apparently late
assemblages at these sites is mixed stratigraphy. But Rosegate points
have been found on structure floors postdating AD 1000 at Wolf Village,
Woodard Mound (Richens 1983:72), Five Finger Ridge (Talbot et al.
2000:Table 6.24), Paragonah (Woods 2009:Table B.3), and other sites.
While no provenience is necessarily conclusive, close association with a
use-surface is usually a good indication that the artifact was used by
the occupants of the structure. More Rosegate points are found in the
fill of structures than floor contexts, but these points are often mixed
with other point types, and we find it improbable that the fill of these
structures is commonly composed of a thoroughly mixed combination of
older and later artifacts. Rosegate points clearly continue to be used
until the end of the Fremont period, although Rosegate points are often
less common than other types in post-AD 1000 assemblages.

# Spatial Distribution

Several late styles of projectile points have strongly patterned spatial
distributions across the Fremont world. For instance, Uintah
Side-notched points are common in northern Utah, while Parowan
Basal-notched points are common in the southwestern part of the Fremont
region (and adjacent Ancestral Pueblo areas), and Bull Creek points are
only common in the southeastern part of the region (and adjacent parts
of Ancestral Pueblo territory; Holmer and Weder 1980:57). Though
Rosegate points were not replaced by other points until after the
Fremont period, they do exhibit some spatial patterning in their
relative abundance in various late Fremont sites.

Figure 8 shows the percentages of Rosegate points at sites used by
Holmer and Weder (1980:Table XIV) combined with the new data discussed
in this study. Sites that date entirely before AD 900 have been removed
for clarity, although some of the remaining sites have long or multiple
occupations that begin earlier. Sites in southern Utah generally have
lower percentages of Rosegate points than most Fremont sites, as do
several sites northeast of the Great Salt Lake. The most distinct
concentration of sites with high Rosegate percentages is along the
Sevier River in central Utah. Several of the sites in this area have
percentages of Rosegate points above 50% (Backhoe Village, East Fork
Village, Pharo Village, and Hunchback Shelter). The early components of
these sites may contribute to the high values, but the sites also have
relatively large assemblages, and the pattern is probably valid for the
later Fremont period. Sites along the margins of the Fremont region in
Colorado, Nevada, and near the Utah/Nevada border, also have relatively
high percentages of Rosegate points, as do a few sites in the Salt Lake
and Utah valleys. We initially suspected that Utah Valley sites would
have high percentages of Rosegate points based on the number of these
points found at Wolf Village; however, the sites in Utah Valley that
date exclusively after AD 1000 have some of the lowest percentages of
Rosegate points in our dataset. Each of the sites in the late period is
below average for other sites in the period (Kay's Cabin, Hinckley
Mounds, Woodard Mound, and the late occupation at Wolf Village). Most of
the sites along the Utah/Nevada border and west of the Great Salt Lake
(Swallow Shelter, O'Malley Shelter, and Hogup Cave) are caves or rock
shelters that have long depositional histories, which may explain the
higher percentage of Rosegate points in these sites, although possibly
percentages of Rosegate points are high because they have a stronger
connection to groups further west.

```{r figure 8, fig.cap=captions[14]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 8.jpg')
```

It is notable that all of the sites in this analysis that lack Rosegate
points are found in Holmer and Weder's dataset. This is perhaps because
they did not include Eastgate points alongside the Rose Spring data,
although their brief discussion of Eastgate points notes they are only
commonly found in the northwest quarter of the Fremont region (Holmer
and Weder 1980:60), which would not affect the sites outside this area.
Overall, our spatial analysis demonstrates that Rosegate points are
widespread throughout Fremont territory, but tend to be most common in
certain parts of the region, especially in the Sevier River Valley.

# Rosegate Morphology

Our intent in this section is to explore the gradation between Rose
Spring and Eastgate points using geometric morphometric (GM) landmark
analysis. We used published illustrations and photographs from seven
sites (see Table 3), as well as photographs from Wolf Village. We
included points typed as Rosegate, Eastgate, Parowan Basal-notched
(hereafter Parowan), and unclassified side-notched points. The inclusion
of the Parowan and side-notched points is used as a control to test how
well this analysis can discriminate between types. Parowan points are
most commonly found in the southwestern Fremont region and bordering
areas. They are morphologically similar to Rosegate points but with
basal notches instead of corner notches and a flat-base preform instead
of a rounded-base preform (see Holmer and Weder 1980). In GM, landmarks
are specific locations on each object that correspond to features on
other objects. Projectile points have some features that correspond
between different types (such as tips and corners), but here we use
semi-landmarks. Semi-landmarks are evenly spaced points along an edge or
other feature and are often used on object outlines (Bookstein 1997).
The semi-landmark coordinates must be aligned prior to further analysis.
Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), developed by Gower (1975) and
later adapted for GM by Rohlf and Slice (1990), is a way to rotate,
scale, and align a series of landmarks. GPA-based analysis is one of the
most commonly used GM methods in archaeology (e.g., Buchanan and Collard
2010; Cardillo 2010; Lycett et al. 2010; MacLeod 2018; Okumura and
Araujo 2019; Selden et al. 2018; Shott and Trail 2010; Smith et al.
2015; Thulman 2019). The aligned coordinates can be used in standard
multivariate statistical analyses.

```{r table 3}
import('Rosegate Table 3.xlsx') %>% 
  kable(booktabs = T, caption = captions[4]) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10,full_width = F, position = "center")
```

A potential problem for projectile point analyses and typologies is the
modification of a point throughout its use-life. The term retouching
describes modifications to a stone tool after its initial shaping
(Whittaker 1994:19). Retouching is generally done to increase the
sharpness of the blade, although these modifications can sometimes
affect the typology of the point (e.g., Bamforth 1991; Flenniken and
Raymond 1986; Gardner and Verrey 1979; Larick 1985; Thomas 1986).
However, experiments indicate this is rarely a problem for small
arrowpoints. Loendorf and colleagues (see also Cheshier and Kelly 2006;
2019) conducted an experimental study of arrowpoints, comparable to
Rosegate points, and found that the breakage patterns and decline in
performance for reworked points make these points unlikely to be
affected by reworking. Notably, attempting to rework points resulted in
unusual morphologies rarely or never found in the archaeological record.
This perhaps justifies the analysis of the entire point outline, but we
elected to focus our analysis on the base, as base shape is usually the
primary discriminant between types in the Great Basin (Holmer 1986;
Holmer and Weder 1980; Thomas 1981) and does not seem likely to be
affected by reworking. This has the added bonus of increasing the sample
size as many points are damaged at the tip or along one side and must be
discarded in an analysis considering the entire outline.

Landmarks are usually added manually, but this means landmarks can be
subjective and subject to human error. Instead, we automated the process
to create semi-landmarks using the R statistical language (R Core Team
2020) and the Momocs package (Bonhomme et al. 2014). The R script used
to process the images is publicly available (see data availability
statement), but we briefly describe the process here. Each image is
converted to a matrix of points representing the outline of the
projectile point. These matrices are aligned and centered and then the
upper half of the point and the left half of the point are removed (see
Figure 9). This leaves a corner of the projectile point to be used for
the landmarks. This method could be refined by separating the blade and
base components, but we found this shortcut to work effectively. Only a
corner was used in the analysis instead of the entire base in order to
eliminate biases from asymmetric points and to use points where one side
of the base was damaged. Furthermore, the inclusion of part of the blade
margin provides additional shape variation for analysis and is unlikely
to cause problems given the general lack of extensive resharpening in
these points. The remaining coordinates for the projectile point corner
are then sampled so that an equal number of coordinates remain for all
projectile points, which is required for GPA. We chose 35 as this is the
approximate average number of points remaining after the removal of the
other points. GPA and principal components analysis were then applied to
align and transform the coordinates into principal component vectors.

```

Figure 10 shows the first two principal components, as well as the
morphospace, which demonstrates the relationship between the principal
components scores and the shape of the outlines. Side notch points and
Parowan points are mostly separated from Rose Spring and Eastgate,
although one point originally classified as Parowan appears to be
misclassified. Rose Spring and Eastgate are, however, mostly
overlapping.

Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the PCA results allows us to
test how accurately the original typologies can be reproduced using this
analysis. While true training and validation sets were not used in this
small experiment, this provides a sense of how a GM approach compares to
traditional methods. Table 4 shows the results of the predicted types
using LDA and the original classification. The accuracy overall was 84%
(n = 193). Each type had over 90% accuracy, except Eastgate which was
62%. The combination of Rose Spring and Eastgate into a Rosegate
category would eliminate much of the error and increase the accuracy
rate to 93%. The question remains, can Rose Spring and Eastgate points
be reasonably separated, or should they be considered one type?

```{r table 4}
t4 <- import('Rosegate Table 4.xlsx') %>% 
  as_tibble()
colnames(t4) = t4[1,]
t4 = t4[-1,-1]
colnames(t4)[1] = "Actual Type"

t4 %>%
  kable(booktabs = T, caption = captions[5],
        escape = T) %>%
  add_header_above(c("","Predicted Type" = 5)) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"),
                font_size = 10)
```

Rose Spring and Eastgate points appear to lie along a continuous
spectrum of morphological variability, but difficulty separating them
may also be due to analyst error or to definitional error. The PCA plot
does little to separate these two types, although the LDA analysis does
a better job. Uniform manifold application and projection (UMAP) is a
relatively recent algorithm for reducing dimensionality (McInnes et al.
2020). We use the algorithm as implemented through the "umap" package in
R (Konopka 2020). The PCA results from the GPA analysis were used as the
input for the UMAP algorithm and a K-means cluster analysis was used to
create two groups. Figure 11 shows the results of this analysis. The
K-means clearly only used one axis to separate the types. The group 2
points on the right-hand side would better fit group 1, but overall,
this analysis produced a u-shaped distribution with some separation
between the two groups. The original types, however, are not well
separated.

```{r figure 11, fig.cap=captions[17]}
knitr::include_graphics('Rosegate Figure 11.jpg')
```

This analysis suggests that Rose Spring and Eastgate cannot clearly be
distinguished. Certain specimens are more clearly Eastgate or Rose
Spring using the current definitions, but many points cannot be
discriminated with reasonable certainty. Typologies are something we
construct as necessary to make interpreting variation easier, but the
difficulty of separating these types arguably supports the use of the
combined Rosegate type, unless a particular research question requires a
finer-grained distinction. If the types were to be redefined using a GM
approach, then we would recommend a larger sample size and a more
refined clustering approach.

# Discussion

The focus of this study is the chronology, distribution, and form of
Rosegate points; however, the results of this analysis and the available
data on Fremont projectile points open additional avenues for future
research. As the projectile point data demonstrates, multiple styles are
the norm at Fremont sites. Rosegate points were found throughout the
region, but after the introduction of side-notched and other point types
they were rarely the most common style. Can the differences be explained
by functional concerns? Hunting and warfare have different functional
requirements and are likely causes of the simultaneous use of different
styles in some cases (Loendorf et al. 2015). Yet functional requirements
are unlikely to be responsible for the spatial variation noted in this
analysis. Stone projectile points are almost exclusively used for large
game or warfare (Ellis 1997). Big game animals may vary in quantity
throughout the Fremont region, but the same types of large mammals
(deer, pronghorn, elk, etc.) are found throughout. Thus, there is little
reason for stone projectile points to vary in style exclusively for
hunting purposes without reference to the historical trajectories of
their makers. Projectile points are associated with various social and
symbolic functions in nearby areas of the Southwest (Bayman 2007:78--79;
Beaglehole 1936; Cushing 1883; Dittert 1959; Fewkes 1898; Justice
2002b:309--310; Kaldahl 2000; Kamp et al. 2016; Parsons 1932, 1939;
Russell 1908; Sedig 2014; Simpson 1953; Stevenson 1884, 1894, 1903;
Whittaker and Kamp 2016). Certainly, several aspects of social behavior
influence the form of a projectile point. These behaviors can form
recognizable patterns that may provide new ways to study the Fremont
when combined with additional data.

Projectile points are often used as markers of social identity by
archaeologists (e.g., Mason 1894:655; Waguespack et al. 2009:787;
Whittaker 1994:260--268). For example, Desert Side-notched points are
associated with the Numic people (Bettinger and Baumhoff 1982; Delacorte
2008). Ethnographic research supports this association (e.g., Clark
2001:6--22; Garfinkel 2007; Wiessner 1983). This identity is caused
either by an association between an identifiable point form and a
self-identified social group or because individuals learned knapping in
the same communities of practice (Lave and Wenger 1991; Wenger 1998).
However, projectile point styles often seem to cross archaeologically
defined borders (Holmer and Weder 1980:67--68; Simms 1990:4), which
complicates the use of projectile points as markers of identity. Jones
(1994:73) points out that the widespread distribution of Rosegate points
indicates the makers likely did not share ethnicity or language.
Nevertheless, artifacts do not have to be specific to only one social
group to be used to be associated with identity. Objects can be actively
used to signal identity, as in emblemic style (Wiessner 1983), but in
many cases, objects may be associated with a particular social group
merely through association in a particular context. For example, Curta
(2007:174) notes that medieval brooch styles in Hungary differ between
the east and the west: eastern style brooches resemble brooches in
Italy, whereas western brooches resemble styles in Germany and France.
Thus, the brooches are associated with Hungarian identities and are
useful contextual information, but they are not exclusive to Hungary. A
recent study found that the distribution of projectile point types most
likely corresponds to the area covered by speakers of a group of related
languages, rather than any smaller social unit (Buchanan et al. 2019),
thus recognizable ethnic groups would probably be too small to have a
unique style. In summary, projectile point types likely reflect social
identity at some level, although the association may be quite broad and
may cross the social boundaries of smaller units.

If projectile points can be used to define distinct material complexes,
then perhaps the introduction of various new point types sometime
between AD 800 and 1000 may represent an influx of people from other
regions (Allison 2019; Janetski 1993; see Madsen and Simms 1998 for a
general discussion of Fremont origins). The number and size of sites
dating after this period are significantly higher than before and
suggest that some migration occurred.

Projectile points have been used previously to argue for migration in
the Fremont region. For example, Holmer and Weder (1980:68) cite several
arguments using projectile point types for the movement of people from
the Plains and Ancestral Pueblo regions. They argue that the projectile
point data in their analysis support both hypotheses. They also suggest
that matrilocality provides an explanation for the multiplicity of
styles found in Fremont sites. If men practiced in a particular knapping
style often moved to new villages, then it would intuitively create this
pattern---a possibility worth exploring although it would likely require
reference to other types of material culture. Because Rosegate points
are never replaced but continue to be manufactured and used until the
end of the Fremont period, these points may be representative of
descendants of Great Basin Archaic peoples whose ancestors had long
inhabited the Fremont region. The spatial analysis suggests that some
areas had much higher or lower percentages of Rosegate points than would
be expected if the points were distributed evenly. Areas with high
percentages of Rosegate points may be places where in-migration was less
frequent. This explanation is appealing but requires evidence, as
Rosegate points and similar points are widespread, including in the
Southwest.

# Conclusion

Almost one in four projectile points from Fremont sites dating after AD
1000 is a Rosegate point, indicating that these points were still
manufactured and used alongside other point types. We are not the first
to suggest this; for example, long before the current typology was
developed, Wormington (1955:109) stated that corner-notched points were
never completely abandoned. This recognition is far from universal,
however, and recent discussions of Rosegate chronology focus almost
exclusively on the western Great Basin. We do note that Fremont sites
with a large number of Rosegate points and no later point types likely
date early in the Fremont period, although this interpretation should be
made cautiously. The modest GM study conducted here demonstrates a
significant overlap between Rose Spring and Eastgate points. Given that
the term Rosegate has long been used, we recommend continued use of the
term Rosegate for future studies. Although our conclusions are not
novel, our aim is to more clearly define the chronology and form of
Rosegate points to increase compatibility between projectile point
studies. Furthermore, there is evidence that Rosegate points have high
concentrations in some areas after AD 1000, such as along the Sevier
River. While they are generally found throughout the Fremont region,
further analysis may identify material culture complexes that include
higher than usual numbers of Rosegate points. This line of inquiry may
clarify some of the internal complexity recognized within the Fremont
region.

While types are a useful analytical construct, GM techniques provide a
method to move beyond simple typologies. These methods provide
continuous variables that can demonstrate how closely related forms are
and are a useful way to gauge the similarity between different
projectile points without reliance on classification. These methods are
adaptable and the analysis we conducted requires only a photograph or
illustration of each projectile point. The application of GM methods to
a regional study of Fremont projectile points will likely provide a
number of insights into social relations between different areas.
